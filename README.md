# Assembly Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Assembly

## Projects
### Project 1: Hello, World!
**Overview:**
- Write a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Basic syntax and structure of an Assembly program.
- How to use an assembler and linker.
- Understanding the use of system calls to perform I/O operations.

**Technologies/Frameworks:**
- NASM (Netwide Assembler) or MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler).
- Basic text editor or an IDE with Assembly support.

### Project 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations
**Overview:**
- Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers provided by the user.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Working with registers and memory.
- Understanding and using data types.
- Implementing basic input/output operations.

### Project 3: Simple Calculator
**Overview:**
- Develop a simple calculator that can handle multiple operations and expressions.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Conditional statements and loops.
- Stack operations for handling multiple expressions.
- More complex input/output handling.

### Project 4: String Manipulation
**Overview:**
- Write a program that performs various string operations such as concatenation, reversal, and finding substrings.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Working with character arrays and pointers.
- Understanding how strings are stored in memory.

### Project 9: Simple Game (e.g., Snake or Tic-Tac-Toe)
**Overview:**
- Create a simple game like Snake or Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Game logic and state management.
- Real-time input handling.
- Basic graphics rendering (console-based).

- Consider using graphical libraries if you want to explore beyond console applications.

### Project 10: Basic Operating System Kernel
**Overview:**
- Write a very basic operating system kernel that can boot, print to the screen, and perform basic tasks.

**Skills to Focus On:**
- Understanding low-level system architecture.
- Interrupt handling and basic scheduling.
- Managing hardware through Assembly.
